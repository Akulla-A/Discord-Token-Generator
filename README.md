# A Discord Token Generator
A "working" discord token generator with puppeteer

It's not fully working, the script is not perfect because I didn't finish it.
However, it should work more than 60-70% or try.
Also, the code may be not clean and improved. It's one of my first javascript code and first time I was using puppeteer

Require Node.JS, using 2Captcha api and a residential rotating proxy

It's for education, I won't be responsible for any action you take with this script
